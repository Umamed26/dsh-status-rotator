## Quick start

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-status-rotator   # 1. install (the package ships its own bundle manifest)
dsh web                                            # 2. restart once, first install only
```

3. Open **Settings → Status Texts** (bottom left): toggle theme packs, edit phrases, tune the gradient and danmaku — every change saves and applies live, no refresh.

A [DeepSeek Harness (dsh)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) client plugin that replaces the hardcoded `Deep diving...` / `深度求索中...` status line in the Web UI's turn footer with your own phrase bank: phase-aware switching, typewriter output, timed rotation, weighted random picking, template placeholders with live values, an animated rainbow gradient with separate day/night palettes, video-site-style danmaku, and a real-time engine that feeds the phrases and the browser tab title. The elapsed-time clock of the UI is left untouched.

> **Status line as of dsh 0.1.7**: the host moved the running status into the turn's fold header `button[data-turn-process]` (`Deep diving for 12s` / `深度求索中，用时12秒`, long gone from the viewport in a long turn). The plugin moves the status line **back to the old position** — just above the input box, below the conversation, left-aligned with the message column (mirroring dsh ≤0.1.6's `.turnStatus`: 26px tall, built-in shimmer, clock 13px + 8px gap), pinned with the composer so it stays visible; the header copy is hidden to avoid duplicates and the host's own `Took 12s` / `Worked` returns once the turn ends. Duration and phase are still read from the header label text (React rewrites it wholesale every second — the plugin never writes into it), and the screen-reader announcement span is left alone. On 0.1.6 and older the `role="status"` status line already sits in that position and behaves as before.
>
> **Never a blank line**: `config.labelSource` (default `"phrases"`) decides the text. With an empty phrase bank (plugin installed without a `config.json`) the plugin's own line falls back to the host's `Deep diving...` / `深度求索中` instead of rendering an empty row; set it to `"host"` to drop rotation entirely and get the verbatim 0.1.6 `.turnStatus` look (weight 500, inline-flex, 26px, shimmer, clock after 15s) on 0.1.7.

## Feature Overview

**Core**

- **Status swapping** — the `Deep diving...` label (or the `Deep diving for 12s` running label since 0.1.7) is replaced by your phrases, rotated every `intervalMs`, typed out character by character (`typeSpeedMs`, `0` disables the typewriter);
- **Phase-aware** — separate phrase sets for `thinking` / `running` / `long`; `thinking` covers the first 15 seconds of a turn, then the phase follows the elapsed time, without waiting for the rotation interval;
- **Weighted random** — any phrase may carry a weight; picking follows the weights (`weightedRandom: false` falls back to fully uniform);
- **Zero-intrusion targeting** — locates the status label by `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` on older hosts and by `button[data-turn-process]` on 0.1.7+; there the plugin only inserts its own line inside the composer seat, hides the header copy, and reads the header label text for the duration — chat-history code snippets, other aria-live regions and the host clock are never touched.

**Content**

- **Phrase bank separated from code** — all phrases live in JSON files; editing them needs zero code and no restart;
- **Modular phrase packs** — phrases are grouped into named packs (`packs[]` + `enabledPacks[]`) that merge into the effective bank with text-dedup; the settings page toggles packs and edits each one independently;
- **Template placeholders** — `{elapsed}`, `{phase}`, `{phaseLabel}`, `{locale}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, plus live-engine values `{model}`, `{provider}`, `{tps}`, `{pending}`, `{tools}`, `{running}`;
- **Observation channel (retries made visible)** — surfaces the **structured** signals the host appends to the session event log: today `llm/retry` / `llm/retry-started` (a small badge on the status line, `⟳ 3/5` by default) plus `{retry}`, `{retryMax}`, `{retryProvider}`, `{retryCode}` and `{detail}` placeholders; on hosts without an event window nothing is shown (no counting guessed from logs or UI text, and only short redacted error codes are ever rendered).
- **Multilingual** — phrases switch live between Chinese and English following Settings → Language; unknown languages fall back to Chinese;
- **Community phrase bot** — a GitHub-issue form with an automatic validator and auto-PR (see [Contributing Phrases](#contributing-phrases-via-github-issues)).

**Visuals**

- **Rainbow gradient** — text rendered with an animated gradient; separate day (light) / night (dark) palettes that follow the interface theme (or force one with `mode`); colors and speed configurable, one switch to turn off;
- **Danmaku** — every phrase can also fly across the page as bullet-screen comments; random size, per-bullet random rainbow colors, adjustable opacity and z-index.

**Live**

- **Real-time status engine** — subscribes to the dsh session snapshot (session list, conversation snapshot, model RPC) with a DOM clock fallback — one source feeding phrases and the tab title;
- **Browser tab title** — rotates `document.title` through your templates, your own text while idle, switchable and editable on the settings page (off by default; when off it never touches the title, and it never overwrites a title written by the host or another plugin);
- **Presets & scheduling** — multiple named phrase banks with their own config, switched from the settings page or automatically by time-of-day / weekday rules.

**Workflow**

- **Auto-loading** — the node half registers an HTTP route to serve `config.json`; no localStorage or deployment needed;
- **Hot reload** — while the page stays open the config is re-read periodically and immediately when you switch back to the tab;
- **Persistent storage** — saved edits are written into the plugin's own data directory (`$DSH_HOME/status-rotator/config.json`, which belongs to no package), surviving plugin upgrades;
- **Settings page** — a "Status Texts" page in DSH's Settings with visual editing for the Chinese/English × three-phase phrase banks; saves take effect immediately.

## Installation

Two ways to install: the recommended `dsh plugin add` command, or the manual copy. Either way, restart `dsh web` once after the first install.

### Option A: `dsh plugin add` (recommended)

The plugin's `package.json` declares a `dsh.bundle.patch` manifest, so it is recognized automatically after install — no extra flags needed. The command syntax is `dsh plugin --profile <name> add <package>` (e.g. `--profile web`):

- **From npm** (easiest): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-status-rotator` ← always installs the latest release
- **From a clone**: `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-status-rotator`
- **From a release package**: download `dsh-status-rotator-<version>.zip` from the Release page (it contains a ready-to-use plugin directory with `config.json` — **not** an npm tarball), unzip it, then `dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-status-rotator`.

### Option B: manual install

1. Put this project directory under your profile's node_modules (default `C:\Users\<you>\.dsh\profiles\node_modules\dsh-status-rotator\`);
2. Insert the following into the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - insert:
       - id: status-rotator
         name: dsh-status-rotator
   ```

3. Run `node gen-config.cjs` to initialize the local `config.json` (copied from `config.example.json`);
4. Restart `dsh web` and hard-refresh the browser with Ctrl+F5.

### First run

On first start the plugin serves, in order: your **saved settings** (`$DSH_HOME/status-rotator/config.json`, the plugin's own data directory — see [Persistent storage](#persistent-storage) below) merged over the `config.json` sitting next to the package — or over `config.example.json` when that file is absent, which is the case for npm installs (all 1101 default phrases live inside it — see [Phrase Bank](#phrase-bank)) — plus two bank layers on top: an **auto-updated bank** pulled from upstream every 6 hours (see [Auto-updating the bank](#auto-updating-the-bank) below) and an optional **external phrase bank** (`$DSH_HOME/status-rotator/phrases.json`) you edit by hand, which wins over all of them and is re-read whenever it changes (see [Hot-reloadable external bank](#hot-reloadable-external-bank) below). To tweak phrases or options you can edit a file (hot-reloaded while the page is open) or use the **Status Texts** page in DSH Settings (bottom-left) — see [Settings Page](#settings-page).

## How It Works

### Phase Awareness

Phrases are split into three groups based on turn progress (determined by whether a clock has appeared in the status element and its reading):

| Phase | Trigger | Default duration |
|---|---|---|
| `thinking` | Turn just started, no clock | 0 ~ 15s |
| `running` | Clock visible, under the limit | 15s ~ `longAfterMs` |
| `long` | Clock past `longAfterMs` | ≥ 60s |

Phase changes swap the phrase immediately without waiting for the rotation interval. If a phase has no phrase group, it falls back automatically (running → thinking → any non-empty group).

### Zero-Intrusion Targeting

The status label is located precisely by `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` (dsh ≤0.1.6) or `button[data-turn-process]` (0.1.7+), so the plugin never touches code snippets in the chat history or other aria-live regions. On 0.1.7+ it does exactly three things: insert its own line inside the composer seat, hide the header copy, and read the header label text for the duration — the host clock is only *read*, while the real-time engine derives phase/elapsed from the session snapshot.

### Status line text source (label source)

`config.labelSource` decides what the status line says; both host generations honour it:

| Value | Status line text | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"phrases"` (default) | one phrase from the bank, rotating per phase | the plugin's normal behaviour |
| `"host"` | the host text only: `Deep diving...` / `深度求索中` | when you want the **pure 0.1.6 look** with no meme phrases |

- **Never a blank line**: when the phrase bank is empty (plugin installed without a `config.json`, or a preset cleared the texts), `"phrases"` mode **falls back to the host text** — on 0.1.7 the plugin's own line no longer ends up as an empty row with nothing but the clock.
- **`"host"` is more than a text swap**: the plugin's own line matches dsh 0.1.6's `.turnStatus` property for property — `font: var(--dsw-font-s-strong-14)` (weight **500**, not the 600 the plugin used to hardcode), `height: calc(26px + …)`, `display: inline-flex`, the same shimmer gradient and `250% / 1.8s` animation, plus the `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback. The clock copies `.turnStatusClock` too (`font: var(--dsw-font-xs-13)`, 13px, tabular-nums, caption colour, 8px gap, weight 400) and **appears on the old schedule** — 0.1.6 only rendered it once `elapsedMs >= 15s`. The text is written in one go instead of being typed out, which is exactly how the old host looked.
- **Old hosts (≤0.1.6) are untouched**: their `role="status"` line already shows the host text, so in `"host"` mode the plugin **does not touch it at all** (no text swap, no gradient); `"phrases"` mode keeps replacing the text as before.
- There is a matching dropdown on the settings page (Settings → Status Texts → "Status line text source"), and `{"labelSource": "host"}` can be written straight into `config.json` or a preset.

## Phrase Bank

The default bank ships **1101 phrases**, split into **13 theme packs** (the core `phrases` table is empty — everything lives in packs). Ten packs are enabled by default; the two **star packs are shipped but off by default** — turn them on from Settings → Status Texts → Phrase packs:

| Pack | zh | en | Total | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deepseek` DeepSeek 专场 | 104 | 111 | 215 | on |
| `coding` 写代码日常 | 84 | 81 | 165 | on |
| `daily` 日常 | 77 | 64 | 141 | on |
| `internet-memes` 网络梗 | 56 | 33 | 89 | on |
| `sysadmin` 系统管理 | 41 | 38 | 79 | on |
| `slacking` 摸鱼 | 36 | 29 | 65 | on |
| `math-physics` 数学与物理 | 31 | 18 | 49 | on |
| `western-ai` 西方 AI 圈 | 16 | 18 | 34 | on |
| `reverse-proxy` 反代 | 14 | 16 | 30 | on |
| `china-ai` 中国 AI 圈 | 18 | 10 | 28 | on |
| `star-ask` 求 star | 11 | 12 | 23 | **off** |
| `star-route` 星标者路由 | 89 | 89 | 178 | **off** |
| **total** | **582** | **519** | **1101** | 895 on / 206 off |

- Most entries are zh/en mirrored pairs; recent community submissions are often zh-only — choose **zh + en (both)** in the submission form to get each phrase in both languages;
- 5 weighted showcase entries (see [Weighted Random](#weighted-random)) — most phrases are plain weight-1 strings;
- The bank grows through the community [phrase-submission form](#contributing-phrases-via-github-issues): validated and merged submissions are credited in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md);
- The numbers are computed from `config.example.json` by `node scripts/sync-bank-counts.cjs` (the submission bot and the star-pack refresh call it automatically; run it once after editing the bank by hand); run `node scripts/check-bank-memes.mjs` locally to audit the current bank (duplicates, lengths, ellipsis, series share).

**The star packs (off by default)** — two separate packs, so you can take one without the other:

| Pack | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `star-ask` 求 star | pure star-ask phrases, e.g. `正在向你讨一个 star…` / `Begging for a star…` |
| `star-route` 星标者路由 | **one phrase per current stargazer** — `正在路由 <login> 写代码…` / `Routing <login> to write code…`, so the rotation literally routes every star-giver to work |

They ship disabled because begging is a matter of taste, not because they are broken: flip them on in Settings → Status Texts → Phrase packs. The stargazer list is refreshed by the [`Star packs` workflow](.github/workflows/star-pack.yml) — weekly and on demand (`workflow_dispatch`) — which reads the stargazers with the repository's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so a new star shows up in the bank within a week without anyone doing anything (the endpoint needs a token that can see this repo; a `STAR_TOKEN` secret overrides it). Locally: `node scripts/update-star-pack.cjs --token <pat>`, or `--names names.json` to rebuild from an offline list. Existing installs pick the packs up on upgrade; if a saved settings document already pins `enabledPacks`, the two ids simply stay off until you toggle them.

## Phrase Packs

The bank is composable from named packs layered on top of the core `phrases` table:

```jsonc
{
    "packs": [
        { "id": "community",
          "label": { "zh": "社区投稿", "en": "Community" },
          "phrases": { "zh": { "running": ["正在试用词库包…"] } } }
    ],
    "enabledPacks": ["community"]   // absent = all packs enabled; [] = core bank only
}
```

- Enabled packs merge into the effective bank **in order, deduped by text** — an entry already present in the core bank (or an earlier pack) is skipped, keeping its weight;
- `enabledPacks` absent/`null` = all packs on; `[]` = core bank only. Unknown ids in the list are ignored;
- Packs support the exact same entries as the core bank (strings or `{text, weight}`, per-phase groups, placeholders);
- The settings page shows every pack with a per-pack **enable toggle** and a **pack editor target**: pick a pack and the phrase library editor reads/writes that pack's phrases;
- The default config ships **12 packs** (`deepseek` / `western-ai` / `china-ai` / `coding` / `reverse-proxy` / `sysadmin` / `math-physics` / `slacking` / `internet-memes` / `daily` / `star-ask` / `star-route`) and pins `enabledPacks` to the ten non-star ids, so the two star packs ship **off by default** — the core table is empty, so disabling a pack really removes that theme from the pool;
- The phrase-submission form has a **目标词库包** picker (same pack ids plus `community` as the default landing spot): submissions land in the chosen pack, and a `community` pack is created on first use — the core bank stays untouched, so you can disable or prune community content in one place;
- Old configs without packs keep working untouched.

## Weighted Random

By default the wording is picked uniformly (avoiding immediate repeats). Give phrases a weight and the picker becomes proportional: a `weight: 3` phrase is 3× more likely than a `weight: 1` phrase.

```json
"phrases": { "zh": { "thinking": [
    "正在写代码…",                    // plain string, weight 1
    { "text": "正在加水…", "weight": 3 }   // 3× more likely
] } }
```

- A phrase entry is a plain string (weight 1) or an object `{ "text": "...", "weight": 3 }`; `weight` must be a positive number (decimals allowed), values above 1000 clamp to 1000, invalid/missing weights count as 1. Weight entries are fully optional — old string-only phrase banks work unchanged.
- In the **settings editor** write `text | weight` per line: `正在写代码 | 3`. The editor re-renders weighted phrases with their ` | weight` suffix on load; the `weightedRandom` toggle in Basic settings switches back to uniform picking without touching the phrase bank.
- Weights apply to the status text rotation **and** the danmaku pool (danmaku dedupes by text, keeping the first entry's weight).
- The "avoid repeating the previous phrase" rule stays: the last phrase is temporarily excluded from the draw (if it's the only candidate left, it repeats).

## Template Placeholders

Any phrase (and any title template) may contain placeholders, replaced at render time:

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{elapsed}` | elapsed time of the current turn, localized like the clock | `正在写代码 1分02秒…` |
| `{phase}` | phase id: `thinking` / `running` / `long` / `idle` | `running` |
| `{phaseLabel}` | localized short label of the phase | `运行中` |
| `{model}` | model of the current session (live engine, `—` when unknown) | `deepseek-chat` |
| `{provider}` | provider route of the current session (live engine) | `deepseek` |
| `{tps}` | streaming tokens/s estimate (live engine) | `12` |
| `{pending}` | interactions waiting for an answer — approvals and questions share this one counter (live engine) | `1` |
| `{tools}` | running tool names joined with `+` (live engine) | `bash+web_search` |
| `{running}` | `run` / `idle` (live engine) | `run` |
| `{retry}` | retry attempt in the current step (live engine; empty when none) | `3` |
| `{retryMax}` | the retry policy's cap (may be empty on older hosts / `always` mode) | `5` |
| `{retryProvider}` | provider that triggered the retry (provider-neutral, passed through verbatim) | `deepseek-official` |
| `{retryCode}` | short failure code (safe token ≤32 chars; URLs, paths and raw messages are never rendered) | `sampling_error` |
| `{retryStarted}` | `1` once the retried attempt is actually running (after `llm/retry-started`), else empty | `1` |
| `{detail}` | the whole observation badge, rendered from `config.details.badge` | `⟳ 3/5` |
| `{locale}` | current UI language (`zh` / `en`) | `zh` |
| `{date}` | local date `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2026-08-07` |
| `{time}` | local time `HH:MM:SS` | `12:34:56` |

Placeholders that change over time (`{elapsed}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{tps}`, `{pending}`, `{tools}`, `{model}`, `{provider}`, `{retry}`, `{detail}`) are refreshed **live** every `liveTickMs` (default 1000 ms; `0` disables live refresh, they then update once per rotation). Unknown placeholders are left as-is, so `{...}` in a phrase is safe. The live values come from a **real-time status engine** that subscribes to the dsh session snapshot, the pending-interaction list, model RPC and the session **event window**, with a DOM clock fallback — if the session API is unavailable, `{model}` / `{provider}` / `{tps}` / `{tools}` stay `—`, `{pending}` stays `0`, and the plugin keeps working. The current session id is resolved three ways, per host generation: `sessions.list.current` (dsh ≤0.1.6) → `localStorage['dsh.sessions.current']` (0.1.7+, whose list snapshot no longer carries `current`) → the DOM's `[data-sidebar-right-session]`.

**Observation channel** (see [deepseek-harness discussion #3669](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/3669)): that thread points out that subagent retries and transport fallback hide behind `Deep diving…`, and that the missing half is a structured data channel. The plugin consumes **protocol events only** (`llm/retry` / `llm/retry-started` from `binding.eventSource`) — no log scraping, no wording inference; the vocabulary stays provider-neutral (`provider` / `code` passed through, never enumerating product-specific codes); with no event window it simply shows nothing. The badge template lives in `config.details.badge` (empty string = placeholders only, no badge):

```json
"details": { "enabled": true, "badge": "⟳ {retry}/{max}" }
```

```json
"phrases": { "zh": { "thinking": ["正在写代码 {elapsed}…", "正在{phaseLabel}中 ({elapsed})…"] } }
```

#### `{pending}` and the session's approval policy

`{pending}` counts the session's **pending interactions** — the same list the UI renders as composer takeovers — where approvals and questions share one counter, so an **approval request** and a **question** each make it `1` while they wait for your answer. dsh publishes **at most one** interaction per session (the highest-precedence one), so in practice the value is a `0` / `1` flag, not a queue length. It is event-driven rather than tick-driven: the moment an interaction appears or disappears, the label is re-rendered — no need to wait for the next rotation.

What approvals contribute depends entirely on the session's own permission preset (sandbox mode + approval policy, switched with `/permission`) — the plugin neither reads nor changes that setting:

- **`ask`** — a sensitive action asks first, and its approval request counts while it waits: `{pending}` turns `1` as the approval panel appears and back to `0` once you click;
- **`never`** — approval prompts are disabled: dsh rejects such an action up front, the client never builds a panel, and approvals contribute **nothing**. Note what the counter does *not* say: a rejection is not a pending interaction, so `{pending}` can never report "an action was rejected";
- **questions** are a different domain and stay pending regardless of the policy, so `{pending}` can still show `1` under `never` while dsh waits for an answer (a plan review, for instance).

So `{pending}` answers exactly one question — *is dsh waiting for me right now?* — and under `never` the only thing that can make it non-zero is a question. On a dsh build that exposes no pending-interaction list at all, the value simply stays `0`.

## Rainbow Gradient

Status text is shown with an animated rainbow gradient by default (applies to the text only, not the clock). Since v0.22.0 the gradient carries **two palettes** — night (dark theme) and day (light theme) — and follows the interface light/dark setting automatically (`mode: "auto"`); `mode: "day"` / `"night"` forces one. Switching the theme re-colors the text live, no refresh. The flow direction is configurable too: `direction` is `"rtl"` (default, right to left) or `"ltr"` (left to right, matching the typewriter — issue #41). Can be disabled or re-colored in the config:

```json
"gradient": {
    "enabled": false,                          // false to disable; true for default colors
    "mode": "auto",                            // auto follows the interface light/dark theme; day / night forces one
    "direction": "rtl",                        // rtl right-to-left (default); ltr left-to-right (matches the typewriter)
    "colors": ["#ff5f6d", "#00ff88", "#4da6ff"], // night (dark theme) color sequence (at least 2, first/last cycle)
    "dayColors": ["#d92b4b", "#0e7490", "#6d28d9"], // day (light theme) color sequence (at least 2, first/last cycle)
    "speed": 4                                 // animation speed (seconds per cycle)
}
```

Existing configs that only set `colors` keep using it in both themes (nothing changes on upgrade); add `dayColors` to get a separate light-theme palette.

## Danmaku

Optional: every phrase can also spawn as video-site-style bullet-screen comments flying from right to left across the page (by default **behind** the UI — the layer is squeezed between the app background and the chat content, visible in the gaps):

```json
"danmaku": {
    "enabled": true,
    "intervalMs": 2500,        // spawn interval (ms); smaller = more of a flood
    "speedMs": 18000,          // time to cross the screen, right → left (ms); larger = slower
    "fontSizeMin": 14,         // min random font size (px)
    "fontSizeMax": 30,         // max random font size (px)
    "rainbow": true,           // rainbow mode: each bullet picks a random color from `colors`
    "colors": ["#ff5f6d", "#00ff88", "#4da6ff"], // palette (at least 1)
    "color": "#ffffff",        // solid color used when rainbow = false
    "opacity": 0.3,            // global opacity (0.05 ~ 1); each bullet jitters between 75% and 100% of it
    "maxCount": 12,            // max concurrent bullets on screen
    "zIndex": -1,              // negative = behind the UI (default), non-negative = above the UI
    "scope": "all",            // "all" = every phrase of the current language; "phase" = current phase only (with fallback)
    "marginTop": 16,           // top padding of the bullet band (px)
    "marginBottom": 160,       // bottom padding (px), keeps the input area clear
    // ── new in v0.19: top / bottom (bilibili-style) danmaku ──
    "types": {                  // per-type switch + relative weight; scroll = the original type
        "scroll": { "enabled": true, "weight": 2 },
        "top":    { "enabled": true, "weight": 1 },
        "bottom": { "enabled": true, "weight": 1 }
    },
    "mode": "scroll",           // optional: force ONE type for every bullet (scroll/top/bottom, or 1/4/5); omit = weighted
    "fixed": {                  // top/bottom style — the single place to change them all

        "reserveBands": true,     // scrolling bullets keep out of the top/bottom lanes (no overlapping text)
        "anchorBottomToHost": true, // bottom bullets sit above the input area (its status line), not merely marginBottom away
        "overflow": "drop"       // full → drop this spawn (same strategy as scrolling danmaku)
    }
}
```

- With `zIndex < 0` (default) the layer is mounted **inside the element that paints the app background** — normally the conversation surface, which is why bullets sit *between that background and the chat content*: visible in the empty area and behind the conversation, never covering the chat bubbles or the sidebar. If your theme paints an opaque background that hides them, set a non-negative `zIndex` to float them above the UI instead — the layer never intercepts pointers (`pointer-events: none`).
- **Mount point is re-resolved on every spawn** (v0.15.2, target refined in v0.16.1). The app frame is located through the shell's own `data-shell-overlay` marker first, then by structure; inside it, the innermost element that paints an opaque background and covers most of the conversation column becomes the host (the layer is sandwiched in it, with `isolation: isolate`). If neither is there yet — the client half loads *before* the shell renders — the layer briefly falls back to `document.body` at a **visible** z-index and is moved into place as soon as the target appears. Earlier versions kept the `z-index: -1` body fallback forever (v0.15.2), or hung the layer on the app frame while the conversation panel painted its own opaque background on top of it (v0.16.1) — in both cases the bullets existed and animated, you just could never see them. If it is still invisible, turn on `debug` and look for `danmaku layer mounted inside the background panel` in the browser console.
- Bullets support the same placeholders as phrases (`{elapsed}`, `{model}`, `{phase}`…), rendered with the live engine values at spawn time.
- `danmaku: false` disables it entirely. `fontSizeMin` / `fontSizeMax` set the random size range (auto-corrected if reversed, clamped to 8–96 px).

### Coexisting with host dialogs: pause behind the mask (since v0.25)

- **Why**: the dsh settings dialog mask is a **full-viewport `backdrop-filter` layer** (a `position:fixed; inset:0; z-index:1000` container plus a `position:absolute; inset:0; backdrop-filter:blur(2px)` child — the mask itself is only 24% (light) / 50% (dark) opaque; see `Modal.module.css` in `dsh-client-ui-primitives`). With the danmaku layer still translating behind it, the browser has to recompute a full-screen blur every frame — the settings dialog **flickers continuously** ([issue #60](https://github.com/01Virex/dsh-status-rotator/issues/60)).
- **Behaviour**: with `pauseBehindMask` (default `true`), the plugin looks for a host layer that both covers the viewport and carries its own `backdrop-filter`. On a hit it stops danmaku outright — the layer and every in-flight bullet (and their CSS transitions) are torn down, the spawn timer is cleared and the host's `isolation` is restored. The moment the mask goes away, everything is rebuilt and spawning resumes. Detection uses hit-testing at the four viewport corners plus the centre (no full-DOM walk), coalesced to one probe per 250 ms, with the 2-second `rescanAll` as a safety net.
- **No false positives**: small `backdrop-filter` surfaces (dsh menus, cards, tooltips) fail the "covers the viewport" test, and a full-viewport layer without blur fails the second one — neither pauses danmaku. The onboarding mask that starts 80 px from the top (`OnboardingSurface`) does not match either.
- **Opting out**: `"danmaku": { "pauseBehindMask": false }` (the same switch exists on the settings page under the danmaku tab) restores the old behaviour — bullets keep flying behind the mask. Use it if your setup never flickers and you would rather keep the danmaku visible.

### Top / bottom danmaku (bilibili-style, since v0.19)

- **Types**: `danmaku.types` carries three entries — `scroll` (the original right→left type, unchanged), `top` and `bottom`. Each is `{ enabled, weight }`; `enabled: false` retires the type, `weight` is the relative chance of being picked at spawn. `danmaku.mode` (optional) forces a single type for every bullet and accepts `scroll` / `top` / `bottom` or the bilibili danmaku-protocol `mode` aliases `1` / `4` / `5` — handy for "only top danmaku". Unknown values are dropped, and anything missing falls back to scrolling, so **old configs keep working**.
- **Behaviour**: a top bullet is horizontally centred and appears at the top of the play area, later ones stacking downward; a bottom bullet is centred at the bottom, later ones stacking upward. Both are fixed in place (no horizontal motion, no distortion with playback) and disappear as a whole after `fixed.durationMs`. Each bullet occupies one lane, and the lane freed by an expiring bullet is reused right away, so two bullets never pile up on the same row. When a type is full (`fixed.maxCount`) or the stack reaches the opposite edge, that spawn is dropped — the same strategy the scrolling danmaku has always used.
- **Style**: white text (the rainbow-off default) with a four-way black stroke and no background block, sharing the scrolling danmaku's font-size range, palette, opacity and render pipeline (same `pointer-events: none`). All top/bottom numbers live in one place: `danmaku.fixed` (defaults also defined once as `DANMAKU_FIXED_DEFAULTS` in `lib/client.js`), so changing one line changes them everywhere.
- **No overlapping text**: with `reserveBands` (default on) the scrolling bullets are placed in the gap *between* the top and bottom lanes, so a scrolling phrase never runs behind a fixed one. `anchorBottomToHost` (default on) puts the bottom band just above the input area — DSH's own turn-status line sits there, and a semi-transparent bullet drawn on top of it makes the status shimmer look like it is "on" the danmaku. Both fall back to the plain `marginTop` / `marginBottom` behaviour when the reserved lanes are disabled or the host cannot be measured.
- **Layering & colour**: top/bottom bullets render in a separate *front* layer placed above the chat content (`fixed.zIndex`, default `10` — the shell's overlay layer is `20` and its resize handles `11`, so dialogs stay on top). Scrolling bullets keep the original behind-the-UI layer, so nothing about them changed. A negative `fixed.zIndex` pushes the fixed bullets back behind the UI too. Both kinds share one palette: with `rainbow` on (the default) every top/bottom bullet picks a random colour from `colors` exactly like the scrolling ones, and with `rainbow: false` they use `fixed.color` (default white).
- ⚠️ **The numbers are reasonable defaults, not verified official bilibili values** (`fontSize: 25`, `marginTop: 16`, `marginBottom: 160`, `gap: 4`, `durationMs: 4500`, `maxCount: 3`) — marked *TBC* below. Tune them in `danmaku.fixed` / `DANMAKU_FIXED_DEFAULTS`.
- ⚠️ **Default distribution changed**: with no `types` in your config, all three types are enabled at `scroll 2 : top 1 : bottom 1`, so top/bottom bullets now appear alongside the scrolling ones. To keep the pre-v0.19 look exactly, set `"top": { "enabled": false }` and `"bottom": { "enabled": false }` (or switch them off on the settings page).


## Browser Tab Title

Optional and **off by default**. When on, the browser tab title rotates through your templates while a turn is running:

```json
"title": {
    "enabled": true,
    "templates": ["⏳ {phaseLabel} {elapsed}", "🤔 {phaseLabel}… {elapsed}"], // rotated every intervalMs
    "idleTemplate": "💤 dsh 空闲",   // "" = hand the title back to the host when idle
    "intervalMs": 8000
}
```

Templates support the same placeholders as phrases. When no turn is active the title shows `idleTemplate`; with `idleTemplate: ""` (or `enabled: false`) the plugin hands the title back to the host. `title: false` disables it entirely.

**Editable from the settings page** (since v0.27.0): DSH → Settings → Status Texts → **Behavior** has a *Tab title* group — an on/off switch, the templates (one per line), the idle title and the rotation interval. Saving writes it into the plugin's config store with everything else, so it survives plugin upgrades and you never have to hand-edit `config.json`.

**It only writes a title it took over itself** (important): the plugin writes `document.title` only while that title is its own. If it never took one over — or has already handed it back — it does not touch it at all, including the **session title the host writes** (`<session> — DeepSeek Harness`) and title changes made by **other plugins**. Turning the switch off hands back the last host-written title and stops touching the title for good.

> That rule was fixed in v0.27.0. The old code meant "if the current title differs from the value cached at start-up, write it back", so it overwrote *any* other title writer. The classic victim is [oh-my-dsh](https://github.com/gulagala001/oh-my-dsh)'s brand rename (it rewrites a trailing `DeepSeek Harness` to `Oh My DSH`): the value read back could never equal the value written, so the plugin rewrote the title **on every tick** (`scripts/title-coexistence-test.html` measures it with both projects' real code: 10 rewrites in a 2.6 s window, with the session title wiped off the tab; 1 write after the fix, title left to the host).

## Presets & Scheduling

Named presets can carry their own `config` and `phrases`; the editor on the settings page switches between them and a time schedule can switch the active preset automatically:

```json
{
    "activePreset": "work",
    "presets": [
        { "id": "work", "label": { "zh": "工作模式", "en": "Work" },
          "config": { "intervalMs": 12000, "gradient": false },
          "phrases": { "zh": { "thinking": ["正在认真写代码…"] } } },
        { "id": "fun", "label": { "zh": "摸鱼模式", "en": "Fun" },
          "phrases": { "zh": { "thinking": ["正在摸鱼…"] } } }
    ],
    "schedule": [
        { "preset": "work", "days": ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"], "from": "09:00", "to": "18:00" },
        { "preset": "fun",  "days": ["sat", "sun"], "from": "00:00", "to": "23:59" }
    ]
}
```

- `presets[]`: each has an `id` (required), optional `label` (string or `{zh, en}`), optional `config` (merged over the top-level config) and optional `phrases` (used instead of the top-level phrases). A preset may be an id-only "shell" that just switches back to the base library.
- `activePreset`: preset id, or `null`/absent to use the top-level `config` / `phrases`.
- `schedule[]`: rules with `preset`, `days` (`mon`…`sun`, omitted = every day), `from` / `to` (`HH:MM`). Overnight windows (e.g. `22:00`–`06:00`) are supported. While a rule matches, that preset is used; otherwise `activePreset` applies. The schedule is re-evaluated every minute and applies live.
- Settings-page edits always target the selected preset (or the base library when "Default" is selected); "Set active" writes `activePreset`; the schedule rules are edited as a list on the same page.

## Configuration

Phrases are fully separated from the source code and live in JSON config files. There are two config files at the project root:

- **`config.example.json`** — the complete template committed to the repo: default config + all phrases (bilingual, split into three phases);
- **`config.json`** — your local personalized config, initialized by `node gen-config.cjs` (only created when missing, never overwrites your changes). It's in `.gitignore`, so edit freely without polluting git.

**Auto-loading (default)**: the plugin's node half registers an HTTP route (`/plugins/dsh-status-rotator/config.json`) that serves the `config.json` next to the plugin (read from disk on every request). The browser fetches it automatically by default, and **while the page stays open it re-reads every `reloadIntervalMs`, plus immediately when you switch back to the tab**, so as long as `config.json` sits in the plugin directory, phrase edits take effect **without a refresh or restart**. The only restart of `dsh web` needed is on first install.

### Hot-reloadable external bank

Since **v0.20.0** the node half also reads an optional **phrase bank file outside the package** — `$DSH_HOME/status-rotator/phrases.json` by default, overridable with the `DSH_STATUS_ROTATOR_BANK` environment variable (absolute path, or relative to the process working directory). It is plain JSON with the same shape as `config.example.json`, but you only need the keys you want to override — the minimal file is one pack and one phase:

```json
{ "packs": [{ "id": "china-ai", "phrases": { "zh": { "thinking": ["正在飞唐杰马…"] } } }] }
```

The node half inspects the file on every request: when it changes it is re-read and re-parsed (an `mtimeNs` + size fast path, then a content comparison, so a rewrite within the same timestamp tick is still caught), and the browser half picks the new content up on its next `reloadIntervalMs` poll — **no process restart, no reinstall, no republished npm package**. Rules:

- only `packs` / `phrases` are taken from that file; a `config` key inside it is ignored, so runtime options stay under the settings page / `config.json`;
- the bank is the **highest-precedence phrase layer**: the effective document is merged as bundled `config.example.json` → `config.json` → auto-updated bank → user config store → external bank, and packs are merged per `id`, so declaring one pack leaves the other 11 untouched. To hand a pack back to the settings page, delete that pack from the bank file;
- the built-in bank stays the fallback: with no such file the plugin behaves exactly as before, and a corrupt file keeps the last successfully loaded copy in service while recording the error (`externalBankStatus()`);
- verify it on a single process: `node scripts/verify-phrase-hot-reload.cjs` applies the plugin, starts a real HTTP server, GETs the route, rewrites the bank file twice and GETs again — all without a restart.

### Auto-updating the bank

Since **v0.21.0** the node half also refreshes the bank from upstream by itself: every **6 hours** it fetches the repo's `config.example.json` from the `main` branch (default source: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/01Virex/dsh-status-rotator@main/config.example.json`, picked over `raw.githubusercontent.com` for reachability) and caches it at `$DSH_HOME/status-rotator/bank.remote.json`. The response goes through the same validation as any other bank layer, only `packs` / `phrases` are kept, and the cache is rewritten atomically **only when the content actually changed** — so a merged phrase PR (or the weekly star-pack refresh) reaches a running install **without a restart, a reinstall or another npm release**. Two environment variables control it:

- `DSH_STATUS_ROTATOR_BANK_URL` — upstream address (your own mirror, a `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL, …); `off` or empty disables auto-update;
- `DSH_STATUS_ROTATOR_BANK_INTERVAL_MS` — check interval in ms (`0` disables); unset = 6 hours.

Precedence on load is **bundled `config.example.json` → `config.json` → auto-updated bank → user config store → local bank file**: upstream changes apply to every pack you have not explicitly customized, while a pack you edited on the settings page (or declared in the local bank file) keeps winning. A brand-new pack added upstream is merged in but stays off until an `enabledPacks` entry ships with a release — the auto-updated layer deliberately carries no `config` / `enabledPacks`. For the same reason a settings save computes its diff against everything *below* the store layer, so auto-updated phrases are never frozen into the user config store as if you had written them.

Failures never take the bank down: an unreachable CDN, an HTTP error, invalid JSON or an empty document is recorded in `remoteBankStatus()` and the last successfully fetched copy keeps serving (that is what the on-disk cache is for). Note that this is, by default, a periodic HTTPS request from your machine to jsDelivr — set `DSH_STATUS_ROTATOR_BANK_URL=off` (or the interval to `0`) to keep the plugin fully local.

```
$ node scripts/verify-bank-auto-update.cjs
```

(Single process, local upstream: it serves A, switches to B, then returns 500, and asserts the served bank follows A → B, that a hand-written local bank still wins, and that the last good copy survives the outage.)

**Persistent storage since v0.6.1 — and since v0.26.1 it really lives in the plugin's own data directory**: saved edits go to **`$DSH_HOME/status-rotator/config.json`** (path overridable with `DSH_STATUS_ROTATOR_CONFIG`). It sits next to the phrase-bank files and **belongs to no package, so no plugin upgrade touches it**. Previously `config.json` lived inside the plugin directory and was wiped whenever npm or a release package replaced that directory; v0.6.1 moved it to the official dsh settings store, but that path **silently died** on dsh 0.1.7-rc.1: the plugin persisted through `settings.register(ns, schema)`, while that generation of the settings service only offers `describe` / `update` / `replace` / `mutate` / `configure` — no `register()`. Settings were therefore back to a single copy inside the plugin directory and were reset by every upgrade (issue [#51](https://github.com/01Virex/dsh-status-rotator/issues/51)). Since v0.26.1 persistence no longer depends on the shape of the host settings API.
The plugin-directory `config.json` remains as a **compatibility mirror**: a save still writes one (and failing to write it no longer fails the save, since the authoritative copy is in the user config store), and the documented "just edit the file" workflow is unchanged — whatever you hand-edit there is absorbed into the user config store while the file still exists (checked on every GET, so within one `reloadIntervalMs`), which is why it now survives an upgrade too.

**The user config store holds only the diff (since v0.19.1, and recomputed from scratch since v0.26.1)**: it persists just the parts that differ from the bundled `config.example.json` (plus the auto-updated bank as a baseline), so the phrase bank stays in the package instead of being copied into the store. On load the effective document is merged as **bundled defaults → plugin-directory `config.json` → auto-updated bank → user config store (your diff) → external bank (when one exists — see above)**. Arrays of objects carrying a unique `id` (phrase packs, presets) are compared **per id**, so editing one pack stores only that pack — the settings page submits the whole document, and a wholesale array would write all 12 packs back. Every save recomputes the diff from the submitted document instead of layering it onto the previous diff, so setting something back to its default removes it from the store rather than freezing the old value. An existing install whose store already holds the whole bank is collapsed on first start: any entry that also exists in the bundled bank (whitespace-insensitive) is dropped as stale bundled data, and only entries you actually wrote are kept. Measured on a real machine: 82,966 B → 1,586 B with zero phrases lost (idempotent).

> Version history lives in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). The host settings API has narrowed twice and silently broke persistence both times: `settingsNamespace()` (fixed in 0.16.1) and `settings.register()` (dropped in 0.26.1 — see above). After upgrading the plugin, **restart `dsh web` once** so the node half picks up the new code; the client half only needs a page refresh.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `intervalMs` | 10000 | Rotation interval (ms) |
| `typeSpeedMs` | 30 | Typewriter delay per character (ms), 0 disables the typewriter |
| `longAfterMs` | 60000 | Threshold for entering the `long` phase |
| `reloadIntervalMs` | 15000 | Interval for auto re-reading `config.json` while the page is open (ms), 0 disables |
| `liveTickMs` | 1000 | Refresh interval for live placeholders (`{elapsed}` / `{date}` / `{time}` / `{tps}`…) in phrases and titles (ms), 0 disables |
| `weightedRandom` | true | Weighted random picking. `false` = fully uniform over phrases. Phrase entries may be `"text"` or `{ "text": "...", "weight": 3 }` (weight > 0, capped at 1000, invalid/missing = 1) |
| `debug` | false | Console diagnostic logs |
| `fontWeight` | `"inherit"` | Font weight of the status text and the danmaku: a number (1–1000; typical 100–900) or a CSS keyword (`normal`/`bold`/`bolder`/`lighter`); `"inherit"` follows the UI (default; danmaku keeps its built-in 600) |
| `labelSource` | `"phrases"` | Status line text source: `"phrases"` rotates the phrase bank; `"host"` uses the host text only (`Deep diving...` / `深度求索中`) with the 0.1.6 `.turnStatus` look. With an empty bank both modes fall back to the host text — see [Status line text source](#status-line-text-source-label-source) |
| `gradient` | see above | Rainbow gradient: `false` / `true` / `{enabled, mode, direction, colors, dayColors, speed}` (`mode`: auto follows light/dark, day / night forces one; `direction`: rtl default / ltr left-to-right) |
| `title` | see above | Tab title rotation: `false` / `{enabled, templates, idleTemplate, intervalMs}` |
| `danmaku` | see above | Bullet-screen comments: `false` / `{enabled, pauseBehindMask, intervalMs, speedMs, fontSizeMin, fontSizeMax, rainbow, colors, color, opacity, maxCount, zIndex, scope, marginTop, marginBottom, types, fixed}`; `pauseBehindMask` defaults to `true` — see "Coexisting with host dialogs" |
| `phrases` | from config file | The phrases (Chinese/English × three phases; partial entries allowed, missing ones fall back to other sources) |
| `packs` | none | Modular phrase packs: `[{ id, label?, phrases? }]`, merged into the effective bank in order (deduped by text) |
| `enabledPacks` | null (all) | Which packs are enabled; `null`/absent = all, `[]` = core bank only. The shipped default lists the ten non-star ids, so `star-ask` / `star-route` start off |
| `presets` | none | Named phrase banks, each with optional `config` / `phrases` |
| `activePreset` | null | Which preset is active (`null` = use the top-level config/phrases) |
| `schedule` | none | Time rules that switch the active preset automatically |

**Value guards**: numeric fields are clamped on both save and load (rotation interval ≥ 250 ms, typewriter ≤ 1000 ms/char, danmaku spawn interval ≥ 200 ms, concurrent bullets ≤ 60, layer ±1000 …); colors accept only `#rrggbb` / `rgb()` / `hsl()` / CSS color names, and invalid values are dropped and flagged in the settings page. Colors are interpolated into an injected `<style>` and numbers feed `setInterval` directly — that is why the guards exist.

**Same-origin writes only**: `PUT/POST /plugins/dsh-status-rotator/config.json` requires `content-type: application/json` and an origin matching `Host` (`sec-fetch-site` must be `same-origin` / `none`); cross-site requests get 403. Without this, any web page could rewrite your local config.

Phrase source priority, highest first:

1. **localStorage single-text override** `dsh-status-rotator.texts[.<locale>]` / `texts`;
2. **localStorage full config** `dsh-status-rotator.config` (paste JSON, applies after refresh);
3. **External JSON**: `dsh-status-rotator.url` > `EXTERNAL_URL` constant > local auto-load (`/plugins/dsh-status-rotator/config.json`);
4. **Built-in defaults**: only `DEFAULT_CONFIG` at the top of `lib/client.js` (no phrases).

If a localStorage override matches, the external `config.json` is silently suppressed; the new version logs a `[status-rotator] ⚠ localStorage override active` warning in the browser console — when you see it, clear the corresponding key.

Old phrase-only external JSON (`{ "zh": [...], "en": [...] }` or `{ "thinking": [...] }`) is still supported and treated as a "phrases-only config" (a flat array lands in the `thinking` group).

Phrases switch live between Chinese and English following Settings → Language; unknown languages fall back to Chinese.

## Settings Page

Open Settings in the bottom-left of DSH and a new **Status Texts** page appears in the navigation. The page is split into four tabs and follows the official plugin settings-page spec (760px column, the same tab / field / input language):

**Content**

- **Edit target** — one selector covering the base library, any preset (`preset:<id>`) and any phrase pack (`pack:<id>`); saving writes to that target. A target that no longer exists (preset or pack deleted) falls back to the base library;
- **中文 / English** tabs, each with three text boxes for `thinking` / `running` / `long`, **one phrase per line**, blank lines ignored; a line `text | weight` sets that phrase's weight; each phase shows its phrase count;
- **Pack toggles** — enable or disable each phrase pack (the ten non-star packs ship enabled);
- **Presets** — pick a preset, **New** to create one, edit its name inline (stored per editing language), **Delete** to remove it (schedule rules referencing it go with it), and "Set active" to write `activePreset`.

**Appearance**

- Font weight, shared by the status line and danmaku;
- **Rainbow gradient**: enable toggle, palette mode (follow the interface light/dark, or force day/night), flow direction (right-to-left / left-to-right), separate day + night color sequences, flow speed;
- **Danmaku**: enable toggle, spawn interval, cross duration, random font-size range, rainbow mode + palette, opacity, max concurrent bullets, layer z-index and phrase scope.

**Behavior**

- Rotation interval, typewriter speed, long-task threshold, auto-reload interval, placeholder refresh interval, weighted-random toggle.

**Automation**

- **Schedule editor**: add/remove weekday + time-window rules that switch presets automatically; the currently effective preset (schedule included) is shown live.

Across the page:

- **Changes save themselves**: toggles and selects write immediately, text and number fields write 400ms after you stop typing (a preset rename writes on blur) — there is no save button and no "saved" chatter; only a write failure shows up in the toolbar (marked red), leaving your edits in place and retried on your next change;
- Every write sends the full JSON to `/plugins/dsh-status-rotator/config.json`; the node half validates it and **writes it back atomically**, and already-open pages hot-apply it immediately without a refresh;
- Switching the edit target flushes the current drafts first, and "Reload" does the same before reading from disk — edits are never silently dropped;
- Numeric fields are validated as you type (the same ranges the node half enforces) — out-of-range values are marked red, and a **Reset** action appears whenever a value differs from its default;
- The footer links straight to [github.com/01Virex/dsh-status-rotator](https://github.com/01Virex/dsh-status-rotator), so the page always has a way back to the source.

After upgrading to a version with the settings page, restart `dsh web` once (so the node half registers the write endpoint); everything after that can be done from the page.

## QQ Group Member Phrase Generator

To turn every member of a QQ group into a phrase like `正在路由（群成员）写代码...` (meaning "routing (group member) to write code..."), use `scripts/fetch-qq-group.cjs` to generate a standalone config file in one go — no need to type out the member list by hand.

Prerequisites: the bot is in the target group and you have a OneBot v11 compatible HTTP API (e.g. NapCat / LLOneBot / go-cqhttp / OpenShamrock).

```bash
# The default group is a placeholder (0) — always pass your own with -g; generates config.qq0.json otherwise
node scripts/fetch-qq-group.cjs --group 123456789 --url http://localhost:3000 --token your-token

# Directly replace the config.json the plugin actually uses (the old one is backed up as config.backup-<timestamp>.json)
node scripts/fetch-qq-group.cjs --group 123456789 --url http://localhost:3000 --token your-token --activate

# No bot API? Save the member list as members.txt (one nickname per line) and generate from it
node scripts/fetch-qq-group.cjs --input members.txt
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-g, --group` | `0` (placeholder) | QQ group ID (also reads the `QQ_GROUP_ID` env var). `0` is meaningless on purpose — always pass a real group id, e.g. `--group 123456789` |
| `-u, --url` | `http://localhost:3000` | OneBot HTTP URL (also reads `ONEBOT_HTTP_URL`) |
| `-t, --token` | empty | Access token (also reads `ONEBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`) |
| `-a, --action` | `get_group_member_list` | Action path (also reads `ONEBOT_ACTION`); frameworks with a prefix use `/api/...` |
| `-i, --input` | none | Local member list: txt (one per line) / json (array) / csv (first column) |
| `-o, --output` | `config.qq0.json` | Output file |
| `--activate` | off | Write back to `config.json` directly and back up the old file |
| `--dry-run` | off | Preview only, writes nothing |

The display name prefers the group card name, falling back to the nickname. The generated file contains only the `zh.thinking` group: per this plugin's fallback rules, the thinking phase uses it directly and the other phases fall back to the same group. The generated `config.qq*.json` is gitignored.

## Contributing Phrases via GitHub Issues

Want to see your phrase in the default bank? Open the **Phrase Submission (词库投稿)** form from the repo's [New Issue](https://github.com/01Virex/dsh-status-rotator/issues/new/choose) page and fill in three things:

1. **Language** (zh / en / both), **group** (thinking / running / long / all three) and a **target pack** (which phrase pack the submission lands in — default `community`);
2. **Phrases**, one per line (up to 60, all [template placeholders](#template-placeholders) supported);
3. (Optional) a signature, recorded in the PR but never written into the phrase bank.

A **phrase bot** then takes over automatically:

- **Validates**: language/group/format, ≤200 chars per phrase, no HTML tags / ad links / control characters, submission checkboxes, deduplication against the existing bank;
- **Normalizes** to the default-bank style (`scripts/unify-ellipsis.cjs` rules): `...` → `…`, trailing `…` appended;
- **Comments** on the issue with the result, a preview table and a **"Try it now" JSON** (paste into Settings → Status Texts → Save, or into localStorage `dsh-status-rotator.config` — visible immediately, no need to wait for a merge);
- **Opens a PR**: on success the bot opens a ready-to-merge PR editing `config.example.json` (tagged `词库投稿`, linked from the issue) — the maintainer just clicks 🟢 Merge and the phrases ship to every user with the next npm release.

Submissions only append string entries to the **community pack's** arrays (`packs[].id = "community"` — see [Phrase Packs](#phrase-packs)) — the core bank and all code stay untouched, no risk to your local config. Rejected submissions get a ❌ comment listing the reasons; just fix and resubmit through the form. Merged submissions are credited in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md). Implementation: [.github/workflows/phrase-submit.yml](.github/workflows/phrase-submit.yml) and [`scripts/phrase-bot.cjs`](scripts/phrase-bot.cjs). **Don't hand-resolve conflicts**: the bot branch is append-only; if it falls behind `main`, re-apply the 词库投稿 label on the submission issue — the bot rebuilds the branch from the current `main` and updates the PR. Hand-resolving conflicts in `config.example.json` easily drops a comma and turns the whole bank into invalid JSON (only caught when `Test` goes red).

## Testing

`npm test` (or `node scripts/smoke-test.cjs`) loads `lib/client.js` in a Node sandbox and asserts the pure logic — placeholder interpolation, elapsed formatting, clock parsing, config/preset/schedule normalization, schedule matching, and the node half's validation — no browser needed. The same suite runs automatically in CI on every push/PR (see [.github/workflows/test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml)).

The danmaku mount logic, the status-line layout (typewriter width lock, long-phrase clipping, invalid-color fallback) and the live `{pending}` refresh all depend on the live DOM, which pure-function tests cannot cover, so there are three real-browser regression pages: [`scripts/danmaku-mount-test.html`](./scripts/danmaku-mount-test.html) (four mount-timing scenarios, plus a top/bottom danmaku scenario added in v0.19 via `?modes=1` that asserts centring, stacking direction and gap, hold time, same-type cap, white-text stroke and coexistence with the scrolling type; two host full-screen blur-mask scenarios added in v0.25 — `?mask=1` asserts the layer is torn down, in-flight bullets are cleared, the spawn timer stops and the panel's isolation is restored, then that everything recovers once the mask is removed, with `?mask=1&pause=0` as the negative control for `pauseBehindMask: false`), [`scripts/label-layout-test.html`](./scripts/label-layout-test.html) (width lock, clipping, color fallback, settings render) and [`scripts/live-pending-test.html`](./scripts/live-pending-test.html) (pending 0 → 1 → 0 → 1 through the real plugin, plus the no-service fallback). The 0.1.7+ status line has its own page, [`scripts/turn-process-017-test.html`](./scripts/turn-process-017-test.html) (15 scenarios, driven by `node scripts/run-turn-process-test.cjs`): header takeover, handing back at turn end, the no-seat fallback, the observation badge, and the v0.26 additions — `?case=running-simple` pins dsh 0.1.7-rc.1's "every turn renders the row" change (`disabled` + `data-open` + no chevron), `?case=no-phrases` asserts the line falls back to the host text instead of going blank, and `?case=host-only` / `?case=host-only-clock` compare the plugin's line property-for-property against a **verbatim copy of the 0.1.6 `.turnStatus`** rendered on the same page, including weight 500 and the old 15-second clock schedule. `npm run test:browser` drives all three headlessly through CDP (needs a local Edge/Chrome); `npm run test:browser:label` / `npm run test:browser:pending` run one page alone. To drive the danmaku page by hand, `frameDelay` / `panelDelay` are how many ms each layer renders *after* the plugin (negative = never):

```bash
msedge --headless=new --disable-gpu --virtual-time-budget=9000 \
       --dump-dom "file:///<repo>/scripts/danmaku-mount-test.html?frameDelay=1200&panelDelay=600"
```

When danmaku is invisible in a running GUI, `node scripts/probe-danmaku-live.cjs "http://127.0.0.1:3080/?token=..."` attaches a headless browser to that page and reports where the layer is mounted, its z-index, the bullet count, and whether a bullet actually paints above the background panel (paint-order check).

For phrase-bank maintenance there is also `node scripts/check-bank-memes.mjs` (dev-only, not shipped to npm): it reports per-group sizes (core + packs), duplicate detection, missing-ellipsis and over-length entries, and the share of series like the 反代/路由 families — pass a candidate JSON as the second argument to compare it against the bank before merging.

## Uninstall

Remove the `status-rotator` line from `cordis.patch.yml` and restart `dsh web`.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. The easiest way to add phrases: edit the `phrases` field in `config.json` or `config.example.json` directly — no code changes needed. Or use the **[phrase-submission form](#contributing-phrases-via-github-issues)** and let the bot validate and open the PR for you.
